## Why This Skill?

Claude Code is powerful on its own. This skill adds:
- **Specialized subagents** — Route tasks to experts (frontend, backend, PM, etc.)
- **Structured setup** — Scripts that handle installation correctly
- **Self-improvement** — Heartbeat tasks that keep you learning *(OpenClaw bonus)*
- **Best practices** — Docs on context management, workflows, pro tips

---

## Quick Install

### Standalone (Claude Code only)

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/jugaad-lab/claude-code-mastery.git
cd claude-code-mastery/scripts

./01-check-dependencies.sh
./02-install-claude-code.sh         # Skip if already installed
./03-first-time-auth.sh             # Skip if already authenticated
./04-install-subagents.sh           # Starter pack (3 agents) - recommended
./04-install-subagents.sh --full-team  # All 11 agents
```

### OpenClaw / Clawdbot

```bash
# Install via ClawdHub
clawdhub install claude-code-mastery

# Or manually
cd ~/clawd/skills/claude-code-mastery/scripts
./04-install-subagents.sh
```

OpenClaw users get additional features like heartbeat-driven maintenance and self-improvement cycles.
